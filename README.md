I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, working in the Living Matter Lab of Dr. Mirela Alistar in the ATLAS Institute. My current research is focused on analyzing small, novel protein structures using various mathematical methods, machine learning, and deep learning. Before coming to Colorado, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I have previously worked on projects related to various fields, including human computer interaction and bioinformatics.

My general research interests are in data science and interdisciplinary applications of machine learning and deep learning. I also have interests in science communication and the intersection of science into public policy and education.
