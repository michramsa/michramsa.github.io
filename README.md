I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado at Boulder, working in the Living Matter Lab of Dr. Mirela Alistar in the ATLAS Institute. My work is interdisciplinary but the overall theme is **methodology development and validation when working with scarce data**. 

My research asks the question of **"When we want to learn about something that only has scarce data, how can we work with what we have to make something new?"**.

Before coming to Colorado, I completed my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and my A.S. degrees in Physics and Biology at Harford Community College.

I've had the pleasure of **working with the Colorado State Government**, being a [**2024-2025 Boulder Black Blossom**](https://www.colorado.edu/support/gar/current-graduate-students/boulder-black-blossoms#accordion-1131676925-1), and volunteering to review travel grants for [**SACNAS**] (https://www.sacnas.org/).
